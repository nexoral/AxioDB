## Security Features

AxioDB includes several security features to protect your data:

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Optional encryption for sensitive collections
- **Schema Validation**: Prevent injection of malicious data structures
- **File Isolation**: Each document stored in separate files with proper permissions
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration out of the box
- **No External Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface (pure JavaScript)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate the security community's efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue in AxioDB, please report it through one of the following channels:

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Navigate to the [AxioDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexoral/AxioDB)
2. Go to the "Security" tab
3. Click "Report a vulnerability"
4. Fill out the form with details

### Alternative Method: Email

Send an email to **ankansahadevelopment@gmail.com** with:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] AxioDB Vulnerability Report`
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected versions
- **Suggested Fix**: (Optional) Your suggestions for fixing the issue

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection equivalent, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and planned fix timeline
- **Fix Development**: Depending on severity and complexity
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is released

## Security Update Process

1. **Triage**: We assess the severity and impact of the reported vulnerability
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix in a private repository
3. **Release**: Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., 3.31.105)
4. **Disclosure**: After release, we publish a security advisory with details
5. **Credit**: We credit researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)

## Severity Levels

We use the following severity levels for security issues:

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data loss | < 24 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, data breach | < 72 hours |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | < 7 days |
| **Low** | Minor information leak, edge cases | < 14 days |

## Security Best Practices

When using AxioDB in production:

### 1. Use Encryption for Sensitive Data

```javascript
const sensitiveCollection = await db.createCollection(
  'users',
  true,
  schema,
  true,  // Enable encryption
  process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY  // Use environment variable
);
```

### 2. Never Hardcode Encryption Keys

‚ùå **Bad:**
```javascript
const collection = await db.createCollection('data', true, schema, true, 'myKey123');
```

‚úÖ **Good:**
```javascript
const collection = await db.createCollection(
  'data',
  true,
  schema,
  true,
  process.env.AXIODB_ENCRYPTION_KEY
);
```

### 3. Validate Input Data

Always use schema validation to prevent malicious data:

```javascript
const schema = {
  email: SchemaTypes.string().required().email(),
  age: SchemaTypes.number().min(0).max(150),
  name: SchemaTypes.string().required().max(100),
};
```

### 4. Implement Access Controls

Restrict file system access to the AxioDB data directory:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod 700 ./AxioDB
```

### 5. Keep AxioDB Updated

Regularly update to the latest version:

```bash
npm update axiodb
```

### 6. Monitor for Security Advisories

- Watch the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nexoral/AxioDB)
- Subscribe to npm security advisories
- Check the [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) file regularly

## Known Security Considerations

### Embedded Database Scope

AxioDB is designed for **embedded, single-instance use cases**:

- ‚úÖ Desktop applications (Electron, Tauri)
- ‚úÖ CLI tools
- ‚úÖ Local-first applications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for public-facing web servers without additional security layers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not designed for multi-tenant cloud deployments

### File System Security

AxioDB stores data in the file system:

- Ensure proper file permissions on the data directory
- Do not expose the data directory via web servers
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Implement regular backups

### GUI Security (localhost:27018)

The built-in GUI is intended for **development and local use only**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not expose to public networks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No authentication by default
- ‚úÖ Binds to localhost only
- ‚úÖ Safe for Electron apps (local environment)

## Disclosure Policy

- We follow **coordinated disclosure** principles
- Security fixes are released before public disclosure
- We provide credit to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Public disclosure is made after fixes are available and users have time to update
